# PSPeanut-GB

A simple and fast Gameboy and Gameboy Color emulator for the Playstation Portable using the [Peanut-GB]() library as base.


## Features

Currently the following works:

- Loading Gameboy games from the directory of the eboot.
- Controls work.
- Rendering works.

The following does not work:

- Sound.
- Saving to the memory card.
- Emulation is not full speed.

## What will change?

I will probably add some color palettes and implement saving. Sound is unlikely to happen. Full speed emulation might never be achieved.
